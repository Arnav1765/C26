First, pat the chicken legs dry and rub them down with the paprika, garlic, and salt and pepper. Cover and set aside.

For the peri peri sauce, add the peppers, garlic, paprika, cilantro and basil to a food processor. Process until well mixed.
Drizzle in the olive oil while continuing to process until the mixture thickens up.
Stir in the lemon juice and adjust for salt.
Use half of the peri peri sauce to cover the chicken. Toss them together to get the chicken legs nicely coated.

You can cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour at this point if you’d like more developed flavor. You can marinate them for 24 hours for deeper flavor penetration.

Bake the chicken for 35-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. They should measure 165 degrees F internally when measured with a meat thermometer. 

For Grilling, Fire up the grill to medium heat and lightly oil the grates. Grill the chicken legs for about 35-40 minutes, turning them every 5 minutes to keep from burning, until they are cooked through. They should measure 165 degrees F internally.

Remove from the oven or grill and toss in the remaining peri peri sauce.

Sprinkle with fresh herbs and spicy chili flakes. Serve! So good baked in the oven.
